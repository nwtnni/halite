04.0: First Rust implementation--very different
05.0: Rewrote and debugged most collision detection code
06.0: Fixed all ships trying to dock whenever a spot opens up
06.1: Stopped sending more ships than docking spots to a free planet
06.2: No longer docking when there are enemies nearby
07.0: Improved defense code: go toward attacking enemy
07.1: Enemy detection radius of 7.0; find closest docked target when attacking
07.2: Magic number is 12.0
08.0: Now hunts down close ships at the end; doesn't change victory rate much
09.0: No more docking overshoot, more wiggling precision, more docking separation,
specialized navigation functions
09.1: Actual dynamic circle-circle collision detection implemented
10.0: Heuristic changes (pressing the attack, swarming to defend, fleeing farther)
11.0: Significant refactoring (plan::execute, twos, fours)
11.1: Fixed anti-rush code
12.0: Stuff
13.0: Rewrite from 0, focus on closest first and go from there
14.0: Now exhibits cowardice
15.0: More pessimistic, better defense
16.0: Fixed defense again, added enemy extrapolation, more aggressive towards docked enemies
17.0: Farther combat radius, retreat towards enemies

// STARTING OVER

0.00: Doesn't dock properly
0.01: Docks properly
